Why understand the job duties, roles, or tools when you can implement things already optimized many times over by other people, included in many native libraries, and can be searched in less than a second.
Esoteric math problems are always the way to go. (But mind you, you aren't supposed to have any resources because no one works in Software Engineering with an internet connection)

## Use
Simply clone/fork/whatever, or just look through the code. This is a work in progress currently. Implementations I'm sure are quite terrible, but hey you can probably get an idea.
